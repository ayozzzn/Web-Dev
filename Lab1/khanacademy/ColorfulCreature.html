        <p>The <em>cat</em> is awesome because <strong> they offer quiet, low-maintenance companionship, being independent yet affectionate, using a litter box, and keeping themselves clean, while also providing entertainment through their playful antics and graceful movements, and even offering health benefits like stress relief through purring and cuddling.</strong>.</p>
